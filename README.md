## Concept 

Moon Jot is revolutionizing note-taking by offering users access to an intelligent launcher through a simple universal shortcut. 

This launcher provides a fluid and customizable text editor, enabling fast and efficient typing. But that's not all: thanks to our API integration via customizable plugins, notes can be instantly sent to tools like Notion or Obsidian. 

Moon Jot stands out by its ability to capture the user's context, providing relevant information such as document titles and authors, or even details from social media platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Currently, some functionalities are available only on **Mac OS X**.<br>
‚ö†Ô∏è The app has been tested exclusively on **Mac OS X**, but I decided to build it for **Windows** and **Linux** as well. <br>
 Please report any related incidents.<br>
However, our solution is designed to adapt to every workflow through customizable plugins.

Moreover, our integrated artificial intelligence allow you a way more customizable prompt interaction than any GPT on the market, thus enhancing the productivity and creativity of our users.
